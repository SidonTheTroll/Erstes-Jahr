# Aim of the experiment 
To measure the thickness of a given sheet using screw gauge and to find the volume of the sheet using Standard Wire Gauge table. 

# Apparatus Required 
Screw gauge, lamina, graph paper 

# Theory 
1. Pitch = $\frac{\text{Distance moved by the screw on linear scale}}{\text{Number of rotation of circular scale}}$

2. Least count = $\frac{\text{Pitch}}{\text{Total number of divisions on the circular scale}}$

3. Total Reading = LSR + CSR * Least count  
$\implies M+n \text{ x } LC$

An irregular lamina is a body of irregular geometrical shape having negligibly small thickness as compared to length and breadth. 

$$
\text{Volume} = \text{Surface area} \text{ x } \text{thickness} 
$$

So, the determination of volume of an irregular lamina involves two steps: 

1. Measurement of the surface area of irregular lamina by graphical method. 
2. Measurement of the thickness of irregular lamina by using a screw gauge. 

# Calculations 
$$
n = 100 - 80 
\implies 20 
$$

So,  
$e$ = $n$ * $LC$  
$\implies 20 \text{ x } 0.01$  
$\implies 0.2$

$\therefore \text{It is a negative error}$

## Mean Observed Thickness 

$t_0 = \frac{1.93 + 1.90 + 1.88 + 1.90 + 1.89}{5}$  
$\implies 1.9 mm$

# Observation
| LSR | CSD (mm) | CSR (mm) | Observed Thickness (mm) | 
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 mm | 93 | 0.93 | 1.93 | 
| 1 mm | 90 | 0.90 | 1.90 | 
| 1 mm | 88 | 0.88 | 1.88 | 
| 1 mm | 90 | 0.90 | 1.90 | 
| 1 mm | 89 | 0.89 | 1.89 |

# Calculations 

## Mean Corrected Thickness 

$t = t_0 + e$  
$\implies 1.90 + 0.20$  
$\implies 2.10$ mm  
$\implies 0.21$ cm

Now,  
v = area of lamina * mean corrected thickness 
$\implies 1.75 cm^2 \text{ x } 0.21 cm$  
$v = 36.75$ $cm^2$

# Result

So, the volume of the given lamina is $36.75 cm^2$

# Precautions

1. Mark the boundary of the irregular lamina on a graph paper using a sharply pointed pencil.
2. Zero error of the screw gauge must be taken into account.
3. Avoid the backlash eror by moving the screw in one direction only.
4. Determine the thickness of the lamina at least 5 different places of the lamina.

# Sources of Error

1. The irregular lamina may not be of uniform thickness.
2. The graduations on the linear scale and the circular scale may not be evenly marked.
3. The number of small squares lying within the marked boundary may not have been counted correctly.
